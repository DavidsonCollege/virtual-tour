Wall is home to about 40 [research labs](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/research) for student and faculty research. 
The labs are incredibly customizable depending on the research being done, and each one has space for one faculty member 
and up to four undergraduate student research assistants. With assistance from their professors, Davidson students have 
the opportunity to conduct research throughout the year and over the summer.
