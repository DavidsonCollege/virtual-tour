The Katherine and Tom Belk Visual Arts Center is home to our studio art and art history classes. The building is 43,000 
square feet of state-of-the-art facilities for painting, drawing, printmaking, bronzework, and sculpting. If you can 
dream it up, you can create it here in the VAC! Within the VAC, we have a Lecture Hall, Seminar Room, Art Studios, and 
Classrooms. The classrooms are unique to the course being taught, so students are free to come back and work on their 
artwork anytime throughout the semester. 

Art majors are allowed to apply for a studio beginning in their junior year on a semester by semester basis. 
These studios are right alongside professor's studios, a great opportunity for collaboration. This is one of the many 
examples of how accessible professors make themselves at Davidson. 

The Original Gallery contains about 4,000 to 5,000 original works. Works in the gallery include those by Rembrandt, 
Matisse, Edward Hopper, and Andy Warhol. An original Rodin sculpture stands in the atrium. It is the only one in the 
world you can touch! 

The Van-Every and Smith Galleries are for visiting exhibitions and student art shows; not just for art majors and seniors! 
Studio art majors are required to have an exhibition of their work during their senior year in which they invite friends, 
faculty, and family to see their artwork and sometimes get the opportunity to sell their artwork.
