This is Davidson College Presbyterian Church, commonly referred to as DCPC. Davidson was founded by the Presbyterian 
Church and is still related to the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA) today, citing the Reformed Tradition. This means that 
the college believes that God is not defined by one religion, creed, or belief system. The college supports students 
and student groups of all faith traditions and also those of no particular tradition.

[Religious life](https://www.davidson.edu/student-life/religious-and-spiritual-life) on campus is truly what you make 
of it. Students can be involved as much or as little as they want-- there are weekly services on or near campus, and 
the college is happy to find transportation if there is a service you want to go to that is not within walking distance. 
A number of student organizations exist, including a Jewish Hillel Organization, the Muslim Student Association, Young 
Life, and other religious or interfaith groups.

We also have 4 chaplains on staff-- Presbyterian, Catholic, Jewish, and Buddhist! Their offices are located in the top 
floor of the Union, making them accessible for any student to talk about any issue, regardless of their personal 
religious affiliation.
