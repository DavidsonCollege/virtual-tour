The library has three floors. The first floor is social, used often for group projects, and gets fairly loud in the 
evenings. The second floor, which we are on now, has individual study carrels, and is quieter, although you will still
hear conversations. The Davidsoniana Room is another study space option. Lastly, the basement is a silent work space,
with more study carrels and tables. There are many options for students to choose from for various studying preferences!
