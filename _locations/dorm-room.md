Welcome to a first-year dorm room at Davidson! Every dorm room at Davidson is air conditioned and Wi-Fi enabled, and 
every first-year room has a sink!

95% of students will live on campus all four years. Roommates are chosen holistically using a housing preference sheet 
as well as [the Myers Briggs Personality Type Indicator](https://www.davidson.edu/news/news-stories/141125-first-year-students-decipher-personality-types-for-roommate-pairing-and-career-choice).
Each first-year roommate pair is hand-selected based on their similarities and differences according to these results, 
among other attributes!
