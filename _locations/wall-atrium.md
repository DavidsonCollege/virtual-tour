The [E. Craig Wall Academic Center](https://www.davidson.edu/about/facilities/academic-facilities/wall-academic-center)
was completed in August 2017, and it was designed as an interdisciplinary academic space for students and faculty. It 
is our main science facility on campus, but lecture courses from various other departments also take advantage of the 
gorgeous facility. 

The atrium that we are in right now is multi-purposed. Many students and academic speakers use this space to present 
research throughout the year. When events aren’t going on, this is a great space for students to meet and study. 
Davidson also plans to use this space to host national conferences.

Wall holds a LEED Gold Certification and is a great example of sustainability at Davidson. Reclaimed water from 
condensation in the air ducts feeds the “living” plant wall as well as a fountain behind the building. Carbon-dioxide 
monitors and motion sensors in classrooms determine whether or not rooms are occupied to minimize energy use in heating 
and cooling.
