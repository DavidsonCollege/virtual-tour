The Center for Diversity and Inclusion is a smaller but more visible and centralized facility located on the second 
floor of the Alvarez College Union, between the Union Station convenience store and the Duke Family Performance Hall. 
It is primarily an administrative space for the 
[assistant dean for Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.davidson.edu/offices/dean-of-students/staff/dre-d-domingue) and 
the college's four NPHC organizations: Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Delta Theta, Alpha Phi Alpha, and Kappa Alpha. Davidson 
is adding a Latinx Fraternity and a Latinx Sorority in the Fall of 2018. 

Guests are encouraged to learn more about the striking 
_[Chances Are](http://www.davidson.edu/news/news-stories/130808-ambrice-miller-09-returns-to-paint-mural)_ mural, a 
tribute to Davidson College's racial integration history and the many doors of opportunity and access that were opened 
as a result.
