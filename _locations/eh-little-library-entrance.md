Welcome to [E.H. Little Library]()https://www.davidson.edu/about/facilities/academic-facilities/e-h-little-library! This
is the main library facility on campus, and it is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for students during the school year. 
Students have access to free printing and copying, many desktop computers, as well as our lend-a-laptop program, free of charge. 

The Interlibrary Loan system works to secure students access to any book or article they need from libraries across the 
country. Additionally, the Center for Teaching and Learning is a great resource for students to get tutoring in math, 
science, writing, or public speaking, free of charge. Peer tutors are chosen by professors and trained to provide this 
valuable resource Sunday-Thursday afternoons and evenings.
