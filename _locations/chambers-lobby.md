We are now in the main lobby of Chambers, where the Honor Code signatures of every student currently taking classes are 
displayed. The Honor Code truly guides student life here at Davidson. It states “I will not cheat, steal, or lie about 
college business, nor tolerate others who do.” 

The Honor System at Davidson has been student run for over a century. Students are elected by their peers to serve as 
Honor Council Representatives. Student Defense Advisors, Student Solicitors, and the Chair and Vice-Chair are chosen 
every Spring semester. The Honor Code provides many benefits on campus. Academically, students enjoy un-proctored and 
self-scheduled final exams, take-home tests, and can trust that their classmates are working honestly. Socially, 
students are able to leave their belongings in the library while they grab lunch in the Union, and it’s not uncommon to 
see money-- ranging from a $1 bill to $100-- tacked up on a bulletin board for weeks. No one wants to take it if it’s 
not theirs! 

The [Honor Code](https://www.davidson.edu/about/distinctly-davidson/honor-code) is about privilege, not punishment. 
Students think of the system in terms of everything it allows them to do, rather than focusing on what they cannot do. 
The Code creates a community of trust, and respect, which fosters academic engagement and learning.
