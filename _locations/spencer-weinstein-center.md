The Spencer-Weinstein Center for Community and Justice serves to foster mutual respect and understanding among-and for 
all-people of different cultures, backgrounds, experiences and worldviews, and to help the college achieve its stated 
commitment to diversity. 

Students, faculty and staff create and implement learning experiences that promote social, cultural, and educational 
programs that advance pluralism and inclusivity across the campus. All involved act to make our community more socially 
just because we recognize the dignity and worth of every person.
