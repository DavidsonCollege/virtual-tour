With the help of the [Center for Career Development](https://www.davidson.edu/offices/career-development), staff members 
will work with students from day one of their first year to post-graduation. There are walk-in hours for students to 
get advice or have resumes and/or cover letters looked at. Students can also sign up for a one-on-one appointment. The 
CCD provides services, programs, and opportunities to help students explore how their academic and personal interests 
relate to future professional opportunities; entrance into employment, internships, fellowships and graduate school 
programs; and success through on- and off-campus interview opportunities, employer information sessions, and job and 
graduate school fairs.  

The CCD also has funding grants available for students who pursue unpaid internships over the summer, allowing 
students to take full advantage of any opportunity offered to them. No matter what students want to pursue after 
Davidson, the CCD will work with them to make sure they are on track for success after graduation.
