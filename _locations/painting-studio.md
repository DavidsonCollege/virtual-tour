Art history courses are taught in the 50-seat lecture hall, the Mary D.B.T. Semans Auditorium, with complete audio-visual 
capability. The adjacent seminar room also provides digital access to work studied in each currently offered course.

Card access allows this and other work and study areas of the Visual Arts Center to be available to art students 18 hours
a day. The slide and digital collection of more than 70,000 images is managed by a visual arts curator and available as 
a resource to students.

For the study of studio art, the Visual Arts Center contains separate shops for etching and lithography, including one 
of the finest collections of lithographic stones in the country. The 6,500 square-foot sculpture area enables students 
to work in wood, clay, plaster, metal, and features an outdoor bronze foundry and 3D printing capabilities. On the 
second floor are large classroom studios for painting and drawing, as well as a state-of-the-art digital lab.

Senior studio art majors are granted individual studios on a competitive basis. Faculty offices with adjoining 
studios and a comfortable student-faculty lounge complete the Visual Arts Center's space. Learn more about
