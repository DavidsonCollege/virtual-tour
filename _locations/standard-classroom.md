Chambers houses a variety of departments, and many students will have several classes in Chambers in any given semester. 
Additionally, many professorsâ€™ offices are in Chambers. 100% of Davidson faculty choose to hold open office hours so that
 students can come talk or ask questions about a class, an assignment, or anything else! Because we have small classes 
 and a small student to faculty ratio, students get to know their professors very well, and oftentimes find many mentors
  here on campus. Professors will even have groups of students over to their house for dinner!

The most popular majors at Davidson are Political Science, Economics, Biology, Psychology, and English. However, we have
 many other majors and minors for students to choose from! Check out the [full list here](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/majors-and-programs).
