This is Duke residence hall, which is home to the Dean Rusk International Studies Program. Dean Rusk supports students
in study abroad opportunities! About 80% of students have traveled abroad in recent years, and about 65% do so for 
academic credit. Study abroad counselors work to help students find the program best suited to their academic and 
personal interests, and financial aid travels with students abroad. The Dean Rusk Center also awards grants to students 
for independent travel and research projects. You can learn more about study abroad opportunities 
[here](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/study-abroad)!

We also have over 100 [international students](https://www.davidson.edu/admission-and-financial-aid/how-to-apply/international-students)
here at Davidson, who are [supported](https://www.davidson.edu/student-life/international-student-programs) through our 
International Student Services. There is a strong international community, and every international student can opt to 
have a host family here in the Davidson area.

Additionally, this is the first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified building on campus. Every 
single building that has been constructed or renovated since then is LEED Silver certified, which speaks to Davidsonâ€™s 
sustainability efforts!
