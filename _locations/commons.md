[Vail Commons](https://www.davidson.edu/student-life/dining-services/dining-locations/vail-commons) is our largest 
dining option on campus. Commons is an all-you-can-eat menu with many options available, 
including gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan options. Commons will often create themed meals. A favorite among students 
is "Commonsgiving" which is a traditional Thanksgiving meal served before Thanksgiving Break. Last year, 1,300 of our 
1,900 students came to Commonsgiving to share a meal with their fellow Wildcats!
