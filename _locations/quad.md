Welcome to the Historic Quadrangle of Campus. Here you will see two of our oldest buildings, Eumenean and Philanthropic 
Halls. These were the original social arenas on campus. Davidson was originally founded as an all-male agrarian college:
men worked the fields in the morning, attended class in the afternoon, and retired to these social halls for conversation 
and debate in the evenings. 

Eu Hall now is home to the Vann Center for Ethics. The Center is primarily known for its Ethics Forum series that are 
open to all students and the public, and addresses a wide range of practical ethical issues and challenges.  

Phi Hall is home to the Chidsey Center for Leadership Development which offers several leadership programs, workshops, 
lectures, retreats, and leadership development resources for students.
