Cunningham Theatre Center is home to our [theatre department](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/theatre). Each year the 
theatre department puts on two main stage productions and two second stage productions, as well as smaller productions 
throughout the year. The main stage productions take place in Duke Family Performance Hall in the Union, our largest 
performance venue. The second stage productions, student-directed works, and one act plays take place in the Barber Theatre. 

Students do not have to be a theatre major to take part in theatre productions! Theatre and non-theatre majors alike 
hold lead roles in productions throughout the year.
