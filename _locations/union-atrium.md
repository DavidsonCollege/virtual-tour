The atrium level is a great spot for open events, and also houses our campus post office, the Center for Career 
Development, and the Multicultural Center. From this level you can access 
[Duke Family Performance Hall](https://www.davidson.edu/about/facilities/arts-and-culture/duke-family-performance-hall), 
which houses large ceremonies and performances like the first-year 
[Honor Code Signing Ceremony](https://www.davidson.edu/news/news-stories/180821-new-students-sign-their-names-to-historic-honor-code), 
Dance Ensemble, and [major speakers](https://www.davidson.edu/news/news-stories/180209-inquiring-minds-have-questions-for-author-george-saunders).
