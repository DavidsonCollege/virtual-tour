This is the Knobloch Campus Center, also known as the [Student Union](https://www.davidson.edu/about/facilities/student-life-facilities/knobloch-campus-center/alvarez-college-union),
which is a main hub for social life on campus. On this floor, you can see the Davis Café, which is a popular meal plan 
option for students. Additionally, the 900 Room hosts a variety of events every week. 
The [Union Board](https://www.instagram.com/dcunionboard/?hl=en) is a student organization that puts on social events 
every week for students. Past events have included free food & karaoke after midnight, movie screenings with DIY pancakes, 
indoor roller skating and milkshakes, video-game contests, or giant ‘Wipeout’ style inflatables on the lawn with free 
ice cream. The Union is also a popular place to study, work on group projects, or hang out and watch TV.
