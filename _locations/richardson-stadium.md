We have 21 Division I athletic teams, and about 26% of the student body are varsity athletes. Davidson 
[Athletics](https://davidsonwildcats.com/) mainly competes in the Atlantic 10 conference, except for football 
(Pioneer League), and wrestling (Southern Conference). 

Facilities include Richardson Stadium, Baker Sports Complex, [Wilson Baseball Field](https://davidsonwildcats.com/facilities/?id=30),
[Alumni Soccer Stadium](https://www.davidson.edu/about/facilities/athletics/alumni-soccer-stadium),
[Cross Country Trails](https://www.davidson.edu/academics/biology/facilities/ecological-preserve), 
the [Carol Grotnes Belk Turf Field Hockey Field](https://davidsonwildcats.com/facilities/?id=33), 
and the [Knoblach Indoor Tennis Center](https://davidsonwildcats.com/facilities/?id=10&path=mten). 
Most of these facilities are open to all students when a varsity sport is not playing on it at the time! If you're not 
playing a Division I sport, chances are you are competing in one of our many [club sports](https://davidsonwildcats.com/sports/2012/10/10/Club%20Sports%20Home.aspx) 
or [intramural sports](https://davidsonwildcats.com/sports/2012/10/10/Intramural%20Home.aspx). 

Make sure to ask about [Flickerball](http://www.davidsonian.com/flickerball-championships/), a Davidson tradition!
