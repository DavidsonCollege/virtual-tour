The centerpiece of the Sloan Music Center is the 180-seat Tyler-Tallman Hall, an acoustically and visually stunning 
recital hall. The two-tiered venue is ideal for intimate musical performances and lectures, and is located on the upper 
floor and features two Steinway concert grand pianos and full audio-visual capacity to host recitals, lectures, and 
master classes. A gift from 1969 graduate Sam Tallman in memory of Samuel Vose Tallman, Stanley Tyler Tallman and Alice 
Berry Tyler.
